The plugin introduces the tiss-indicatrix (quick-and-dirty Tissot-indicatrix realization) term by Szab√≥ and Wirth. The tiss-indicatrix uses circles of constant radius (tisses) instead of the original infinitesimal circles. QGIS contains approximately 2700 categorized projections. 

With the latitude and longitude resolution parameters you can define the resolution of tisses and the graticule. The graticule and tiss segments means the preciseness of the circle and the axes (parallels, meridians). By increasing their segment-value they are getting more precise, exact. The radius parameter means the magnitude of projecting tiss circles. In case of adding more layers untick the Simplify geometry at Rendering.
