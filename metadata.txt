name=Indicatrix mapper
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=The plugin presents the tiss-indicatrix (quick-and-dirty Tissot-indicatrix realization) introduced by Szab√≥ and Wirth. The tiss-indicatrix uses circles of constant (in this case 800 kilometers) radius instead of the original infinitesimal circles. We projects the tiss-circles from a reference sphere to a selected projection. The software uses On The Fly (OTF) transformation method. Then we can study the distortions of the circles in a blink. The QGIS contains approximately 2 700 categorized projections. Special thanks to Matyas Gede for his useful advises.
